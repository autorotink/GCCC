# GCCC

## Objective
I had the opportunity for some training, so I asked some trusted coworkers what I should do!  They recommended GCCC.  I'm so glad they did!
There isn't a lot of coding or anything like that for this cert, but it's great to have an "End in Mind" concerning cybersecurity.

## SANS Instruction
I had the course for about four months, as well as the books.  The instructor was great, and the books are essential.  

## Index, Index, Index
I'm currently making my index and studying...I feel like it's taking forever.  Here's a link to what someone else wrote:

Also, after you're done with the grunt-work, have some fun with making a [cover](https://orlybooks.com/)!
