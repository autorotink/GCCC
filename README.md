# GCCC

## Objective
I had the opportunity for some training, so I asked some trusted coworkers what I should do.  They recommended GCCC.  I'm so glad they did!
There isn't a lot of coding or anything like that for this cert, but it's great to have an "End in Mind" concerning cybersecurity.

## SANS Instruction
I had the course for about four months, as well as the books.  The instructor was great, and the books are essential.

## Index, Index, Index
I completed making my index and studying...it felt like it took forever.  Here's a link to what Lesley Carhart wrote about indexing using her Pancakes Index System: [Better GIAC Testing with Pancakes](https://tisiphone.net/2015/08/18/giac-testing/).  Her method is certainly worth a look (as well as the rest of her website)!

For the GCCC, I broke out the different sections away from the controls themselves, and developed easy-to-reference tables if there was information that repeated itself for each of the controls.  
Much of my index were by key words, and the locations of those words in the books.

Also, after you're done with the grunt-work of making your index, have some fun with making a [cover](https://orlybooks.com/)!  

## Practice Exam
I purchased my practice exam by going to the [GCCC Overview](https://www.giac.org/certifications/critical-controls-certification-gccc/), scrolling to the bottom of that page and selecting the hyperlink to purchase the practice test.
If I were to do everything again, I would have purchased the practice test sooner (like before finishing my index!), so when I felt ready to take the practice test, I could take it.
I had other priorities, and put off taking the practice exam for a while.

But, I eventually took the practice test, and passed!  (Not with a 100% or anything...but I passed!)  I considered purchasing another practice exam (to get more exposure to the way the questions were asked, etc.) but I think I'll just take the lessons learned from this one and continue on! 

One of the things I've done is put information on the book covers.  There are five books that go into depth into the controls.  It's OK to write information on the covers to help you locate the information during testing...AND (bonus) you are actually reviewing the information some more, so maybe you won't feel the need to search for the answer, you'll just _know_ it!

## Schedule Test
I scheduled my test!  Huzzah!  I'm reviewing the objectives that I'm the weakest in (provided to me after my practice exam).
I'm planning on going to a site to complete my test (instead of being remote).  
Time to review [GIAC Certification Exam Preparation](https://www.giac.org/how-to-prepare/) again!
